These are some scenarios for our Partners using our API

Interested in speaking to someone from our sales department? Please email partnersupport@cardpool.com and a salesperson will reach out to you with more information on how to join our Partner program.

## Point of Sale Systems

Our API can be easily integrated into your existing Point of Sale (POS) systems. This allows you to take a gift card as a payment type either online or at a physical store. Customers online can enter their gift cards and in real-time you can get the balance and allow for that gift card as payment.

## In Store Customer Sale
Either using our API or our Web point of sale system you can allow your customers to sell you gift cards for cash or another form of in-store payment either with your own gift card or as store credit. You can obtain real-time balances and interact with the customer in-person to exchange the gift card. This is a great way to engage your customer and make the sale.

## In Store Customer Sale

Have a large number of Gift Cards already? You can use our Bulk Seller program to sell us the cards or use our API in our Partner program if you need real-time balances along with an easy automated way to submit the card numbers to us.
